Template Inheritance with Static File

create core application in root folder 
core application will serve css, js and images to other applications
create static folder inside core folder 
inside static folder create core/css and images, js folder

then inside core application create templates folder 
inside templates folder create base.html file which is parent file 
inside base.html we will load static file 
then link css file 

then inherit this base.html file in same application or another application

to inherit this core application templates files 
we have to give path of templates_dir to that templates folder like

TEMPLATE_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'core/templates')

then add this to templates list inside dirs key

and to add static folder we have to change settings.py
