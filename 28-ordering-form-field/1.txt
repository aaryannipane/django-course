ORDERING FORM FIELD

    order_fields(field_order)-This method is used to rearrange the fields any time with a list of field names
    as in field_order. By default Form.field_order=None, which retains the order in which you define the
    fields in your form class.
    If field_order is a list of field names, the fields are ordered as specified by the list and remaining fields are
    appended according to the default order.
    Unknown field names in the list are ignored.
    fm = StudentRegistration()
    fm.order_fields(field_order=['email', 'name' ])
