How to START / Create  Application in Django

A Django project contains one or more applications which means we create application inside Project
Folder.
Syntax:- python manage.py startapp appname

Creating One Application inside Project
    Go to Project Folder
    Run Command python manage.py startapp course

Creating Multiple Applications inside Proiect:
    Go to Project Folder
        python manage.py startapp course
        python manage.py startapp fees
        Python manage.py startapp result


How to install Application in our project
    As we know a Django project can contain multiple application so just creating application inside a project is not enough we also have to install application in our project.

    We install application in our project using settings.py file.

    settings.py file is available at Project Level which means we can install all the application of project.

    This is compulsory otherwise Application won't be recognized by Django.

    Open settings.py file
    INSTALLED APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'application_namel',
        'application_name2',
    ]
    Save settings.py File

    example:- 
    INSTALLED APPS = [
        django.contrib.admin
        'course'
        'fees',
        'result',
    ]
