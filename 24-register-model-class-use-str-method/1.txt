How to Register Model Class and use __str__ method 

We are registering our table which we had created using model class, to default
admin intertace.
To Register Follow:-
    Open admin.py file which is inside Application Folder
    Import your own Model Class created inside Application's models.py
    admin.site.register(ModelClassName)

    Example:
    Open admin.py
        from enroll.models import Student
        admin.site.register(Student)




__str__() METHOD:- 

    The __str__() method is called whenever you call str() on an object. To display an object in
    the Django admin site and as the value inserted into a template when it displays an object.
    Thus, you should always return a nice, human-readable representation of the model from the
    __str__() method.

    Write this Method in your own model class which is inside models.py file.

    Syntax:
        def __str__(self):
            return self.fieldName

    Example:-
        def __str__(self):
            return self.stuname
