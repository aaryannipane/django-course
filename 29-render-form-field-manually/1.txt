RENDER FORM FIELD MANUALLY 
    Each field is available as an attribute of the form using {{form.name_of_field}}
    {{ field.label }}-The label of the field.
    Example:-{{ form.name.label }}

    {{field.label_tag }}- The field's label wrapped in the appropriate HTML <label> tag. This includes the form's
    label _suffix. The default label_suffix is a colon:
    Example:- {{ form.name.label_tag}

    {{ field.id_for_label }}- The ID that will be used for this field.


    {{ field. value }}- The value of the field.
    Example:-{{ form.name.value }

    {{field.html_name }}- The name of the field that will be used in the input element's name field. This takes the
    form prefix into account, if it has been set.
    Example:- {{ form.name.html_name }}

    {{ field.help_text }}- Any help text that has been associated with the field.
    Example:- {{ form.name.help_text }}

    {{ field.field }}- The Field instance from the form class that this BoundField wraps. You can use it to access Field attributes.
    Example:- {form.name.field.help_text}

    {{field.is_hidden }}- This attribute is True if the form field is a hidden field and False otherwise. It's not
    particularly useful as a template variable, but could be useful in conditional tests such as:
    {% if field.is_hidden %}
        {# Do something special #}
    {% endif %}
