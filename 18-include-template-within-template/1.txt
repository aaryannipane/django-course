How to include template within template using include Tag

INCLUDE TAG:- 
    {% include %} Tag - It loads a template and renders it with the current context. This is a way of "including"
    other templates within a template. Each include is a completely independent rendering process.
    The template name can either be a variable or a hard-coded (quoted) string, in either single or double quotes.

    Syntax:
        {% include temp_var_name %}
        {% include "template _name.html" %}
        {% include "folder/template_name.html" %}

    Example:-
        {% include topvar %}
        {% include "topcourse.html" %}
        {% include "fees/extrafees.html" %}


    We can pass additional context explicitly to the template using 'with' keyword.
    {% include "topcourse.html" with p="PHP" d="Django" %}

    If we want to render the context only with the variables provided (or even no
    variables at all), use the only option. No other variables are available to the included
    template.
    {% include "topcourse.html" with p="PHP" only %}
