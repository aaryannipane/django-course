CROSS SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF/XSRF)

A Cross-site request forgery hole is when a malicious site can cause a visitor's browser to make a request
to your server that causes a change on the server. The server thinks that because the request comes with
the user's cookies, the user wanted to submit that form.


Depending on which forms on your site are vulnerable, an attacker might be able to do the following to
your victims:
Log the victim out of your site.
Change the victim's site preferences on your site.
Post a comment on your site using the victim's login.
Transfer funds to another user's account.

Attacks can also be based on the victim's IP address ather than cookies:
Post an anonymous comment that is shown as coming from the victim's IP address.
Modify settings on a device such as a wireless router or cable modem.
Modify an intranet wiki page.
Performa distributed password-guessing attack without a botnet.
