DJANGO FORM AND Field Validation:- 
    is_valid()- This method is used to run validation and return a Boolean designating whether the data was valid as
    True or not as False. This returns Irue or False.

    Syntax:- Form.is_valid()

    cleaned_data- This attribute is used to access clean data. Each field in a Form class is responsible not only for
    validating data, but also for "cleaning" it normalizing it to a consistent format. This is a nice feature, because it allows data for a particular field to be input in a variety of ways, always resulting in consistent output. 
    Once you've created a Form instance with a set of data and validated it, you can access the clean data via its cleaned_data attribute.
    Any text based field such as CharField or EmailField always cleans the input into a string.
    If your data does not validate, the cleaned_data dictionary contains only the valid fields.
    cleaned_data will always only contain a key for fields defined in the Form, even if you pass extra data when you
    define the Form.
    When the Form is valid, cleaned_data will include a key and value for all its fields, even if the data didn't include a value for some optional fields.
