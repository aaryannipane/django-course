URL Dispatcher or URL Pattern inside Application in Django 

it helps to make independent Application not completely independent

include():-
    A function that takes a full Python import path to another URLconf module that should be "included" in this place.

    Optionally, the application namespace and instance namespace where the entries will be included into can also be
    Specified.

    include() also accepts as an argument either an iterable that returns URL patterns or a 2-tuple containing such iterable plus the names of the application namespaces.

    urlpatterns can "include" other URLconf modules.

    Syntax:
        include(module, namespace=None)
        include(pattern_list)
        include((pattern_list, app_namespace), namespace=None)

    Where:
        module - URLconf module (or module name) 
        URLconf - it is technical name of urls.py file
        namespace (str) - Instance namespace for the URL entries being included
        pattern_list - iterable of path() and/or re_path() instances
        app_namespace (str) - Application namespace for the URL entries being included

    Example: 
        from django.urls import include, path
        urlpatterns = [
            path('cor/', include('course.urls')),
        ]
        OR
        urlpatterns = [
            path('cor/', include([
                path('learndj/', 'views.urls')),
                path('payfee/', include('views.urls')),
            ])),
        ]
        OR 
        otherpatterns = [
                path('learndj/', 'views.urls')),
                path('payfee/', include('views.urls')),
            ]
        urlpatterns = [
            path('cor/', include(otherpatterns)),
        ]




write URL pattern inside Application
    create urls.py file inside each Application (in case of multiple application)
    Write all url pattern related to application, in urls.py file available inside application.     
    Include Application's urls.py file inside Project's urls.py file.


    Example:-

        urls.py file inside application folder
        from course import views
        urlpatterns = [
                path('learndj/', views.learn_django)),
                path('learnpy/', views.learn_python),
            ]

        urls.py file in Project folder
        from django.urls import path, include
        urlpatterns = [
                path('cor/', include('course.urls')),
            ]

        access the views by 
        http://localhost:8000/cor/learndj
