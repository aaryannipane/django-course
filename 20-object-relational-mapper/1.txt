Object Relational Mapper and QuerySet

    Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), which enables application to interact with
    database such as SQLite, MysQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

    ORMs automatically create a database schema from defined classes or models. It
    generate SQL from Python code for a particular database which means developer do
    not need to write SQL Code.

    ORM maps objccts attributes to respective table ficlds.

    It is casier to change the database if we use ORMs hence project becomes more
    portable.

    Django's ORM is just a way to create SQL to query and manipulate your databa
    and get results in a pythonic fashion.

    ORMs use connectors to connect databases with a web application.


QUERYSET
    A QuerySet can be defined as a list containing all those objects we have created
    using the Django model.

    QuerySets allow you to read the data from the database, filter it and order it.

    Querysets are generally associated with CRUD applications.
