Template Inheritance/ Template Extending:- 

    Template inheritance allows you to build a base "skeleton" template that contains all the common
    elements of your site and defines blocks that child templates can overide.

    The extends tag is used to inherit template.

    extends tag tells the template engine that this template "extends" another template.

    When the template system evaluates this template, first it locates the parent let's assume, "base.html".
    At that point, the template engine will notice the block tags in base.html and replace those blocks
    with the contents of the child template.
    You can use as many levels of inheritance as needed.

EXTENDS TAG :- 
    {% extends %} - The extends tag is used to inherit template. It tells the template engine that this
    template "extends" another template. It has no end tag.

    Syntax:
    {% extends "parent_template_name" %}
    {% extends variable %}

    Example:
    {% extends "./basel.html" %}
    {% extends "../base2.html" %}
    {% extends "/my/base3.html" %
    {% extends somthing %}


BLOCK TAG :- 
    {% block %}- The block tag is used to for overriding specific parts of a template.
    
    Syntax:
        {%block blockname %} ... {% endblock %}

        {% block blockname %} ... {% endblock blockname %}

        Example:
        {% block title %} ... {% endblock %}
        {% block content %} ... {% endblock content %}

*RULES :- 
    If We use {% extends %} in a template, it must be the first template tag in that template. Template
    inheritance won't work, otherwise.

    More {% block %} tags in our base templates are better.

    Child templates don't have to define all parent blocks, so we can fill in reasonable defaults in a
    number of blocks, then only define the ones we need later.

    We Can't define multiple block tags with the same name in the same template.

    If We need to get the content of the block from the parent template, the {{ block.super }} variable
    will do the trick.


CREATING BASE/PARENT TEMPLATE AND CHILD TEMPLATE
    We write common codes in base template and create blocks for code which may vary page to page. Later this
    template will be inherited by child templates and child template will override created blocks.
